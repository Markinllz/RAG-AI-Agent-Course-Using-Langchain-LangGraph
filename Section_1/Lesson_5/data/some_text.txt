This is a very long sentence that contains many words and goes on for a very long time to demonstrate how character text splitter works with overlap when the text is longer than the chunk size and needs to be split across multiple chunks while maintaining some overlap between them for better context preservation and understanding of the content that spans across chunk boundaries eowoeiwoefhoewhofweoifhoiweohfwoiefoweofhweohfowehofhowehfioweohifhiowehoifweiohfiohweofhwhiofhiofwhiofhoiwefhoiweohifehoiwfhoiwoheifohiewfhoiwehoifhoiewfhoiweohiefoihwefiohwohfewhoioehwfhoewohfweoifowehofewhofoweofwefoweh eiorfjoierjoferoie jerio jio ge jgoe or gergjeorjgoejr jg oejrgo eorj goer goeroigeoroj goj erjogoergijoer roefer iojgojre ejog ejorgo oergoj ejrgjeriogjoierjogerogejrgeor jgrejgjreogoergoerjoigoiergj erjgoe joegerjgieorgoerjogjergijeor giojejrgeorgoerojgejorjo ejogeoji ooegojgerogro.

Another very long sentence that also contains many words and continues for a long time to show how the overlap mechanism works when splitting text that is longer than the specified chunk size and needs to be divided into multiple parts while keeping some overlapping content between adjacent chunks for better text processing and analysis.

This is the third very long sentence that demonstrates the same concept with many words and continues for a long time to illustrate how character text splitter handles long text by splitting it into chunks with overlap when the content exceeds the specified chunk size limit.
